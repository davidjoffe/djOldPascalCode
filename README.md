All code is Copyright (C) David Joffe 1994-1998. I am placing the code in
the public domain. I would like it if you gave me credit if you use anything
from this, and also I would like it if you would just drop me an email to
let me know if you do actually use this for anything, however inane it
might be.

The code is rather a mess and is not really documented. The program has
many bugs, none of which are documented. At one stage I attempted to start
documenting djwin; you can have a look at DJWIN\W_WIN.TXT, but it probably
won't be much use to you.

I have not even really so much as looked at this code in about three years,
so there may be some surprises in there :)

-------------------------------------------
(2) What is it?
---------------

There are two parts:

DJWIN\  An "application framework", written in Object Oriented pascal.
        Not unlike TurboVision in concept.
ED\     An isometric graphic/landscape editor created with DJWIN.

This was originally something of a programming exercise for me; I had just
finished high school, and decided to learn Object Oriented programming. I
quickly realised that OOP was very well suited to Graphical User Interface
design, and so I went about whipping this up, generally having a lot of fun.

-------------------------------------------
(3) Known issues:
-----------------
- The program tends to hang if you try close any windows.
- The menus only work with the keyboard, not the mouse.
-------------------------------------------
(4) Quickstart:
---------------

- Ensure you have a mouse driver loaded (not sure if you need this if
  running in a DOS box under Windows95; I found I had to restart in DOS mode
  and run a mouse driver.)

- Change to the ED directory. There are two executables, ED and EDD. I
  can't remember what the difference was, but I think one of them was
  real-mode and one was protected mode. They both seem to work.
  Use ED.EXE, it seems to give fewer problems.

- The program asks to select a mode. Try them out. You need VESA. The program
  CAN work in standard EGA/VGA 16-color modes with EGAVGA.BGI, but I think
  you may need to recompile it.

- Try out "file/new" to create both a graphics editor and a landscape editor.
  Stick to ISOGEN.MGF for isometric landscapes, whenever it asks you.

- Use the "Load1" INSIDE the isometric landscape editor to load .MF1 files.
  There are two included, foobar and foobar2. (No other "load" buttons work;
  not the "Load" button in the isometric landscape editor, nor the "Load"
  button in the so-called "Location" editor (I can't quite remember what
  exactly "Location Editors" were for; I think one isometric world was
  supposed to consist of various isometric landscape subsections.))

-------------------------------------------
(5) Program structure:
----------------------

The program is structured as follows:

DJWIN\    The application framework.
ED\       The isometric graphics/landscape editor created using djwin.

I never *really* created anything other than ED with DJWIN, so I am not
entirely sure that the functionality of DJWIN and of ED are seperated as well
as they should be. I vaguely remember creating a very basic test app, right
when I started .. hmmm .. should try dig that up.

Menus, if I remember correctly, follow their own design.

Applications derive from TApplication, which has a (very) few methods,
basically, init, Run, HandleMenuCommand. ED derives from TApplication, with
TEd (ED\ED.PAS).

A "TApp" is a "sub-application" running in its own window inside a
TApplication desktop, for example, the graphics editor and landscape editors
derive from TApp. TApp derives from TWindow.

A special type of window is a dialog box, a TDialog, which also derives
from TWindow. (see DJWIN\W_WIN.PAS).

All "widgets" (buttons, text labels, grids etc) are inherited from TItem.
See DJWIN\W_ITEM.PAS. Each TItem derivative understands various standard
virtual methods, such as Show (to draw itself), Init, HandleMouse, HandleKey
(I never really implemented HandleKey though), Move, FillBackground etc.
