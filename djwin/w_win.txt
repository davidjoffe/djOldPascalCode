Gee. I have decided to start making a usage handbook for the DJ windows-based
application framework.

object TWindow
--------------
   Everything that resides inside a window is also an object, whether it be a
grid to edit a drawing in or a button or a switch or even a piece of text.
It is possible to write or draw directly into a window but it is _strongly
discouraged_.
   The item linked list is created in the following way (see the docs on items
for the creation of each item object):

	items:=
		NewStaticText(.....,
		NewButton(.......,
        	NewWhatever(.....,
        	NewButton(.......,
        	NewStaticText(.....,
	nil)))));

The last item in the linked list _MUST BE NIL_. If it is not then expect to
see the program crash. For linking in a static variable item a special routine
is provided for this called "Link" which takes the address of the item and
returns the address of the item. This seems to make no sense but the return
must be passed along to the previous item. In functions like "NewButton" this
is part of the parameters. If you dont know what I am talking about dont worry
I am not too sure either anymore. All I know is that the last time I used the
stuff it worked.
